You are acting as a Principal Quant Engineer and System Refactoring Specialist.

You are given an EXISTING AI-assisted MT5 trading system
that already works but requires professional-level refinement.

Your task is to:
- refactor
- simplify
- optimize
- harden

the system WITHOUT changing its core philosophy.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SYSTEM CONTEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The system consists of:
- Offline AI models (Python)
- Signal fusion & decision logic
- Deterministic risk engine
- MT5 execution EA using ONNX

The system must remain:
- modular
- explainable
- replaceable
- competition-ready

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
REFACTOR OBJECTIVES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Reduce complexity without reducing capability.
2. Improve clarity of responsibilities between modules.
3. Eliminate hidden coupling between AI and execution.
4. Improve performance (latency, memory, execution speed).
5. Improve logging and observability.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHAT TO ANALYZE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Feature engineering redundancy
2. Signal fusion logic clarity
3. Decision bottlenecks
4. Risk rule conflicts
5. EA execution safety

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DELIVERABLES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Refactored architecture diagram (text-based)
2. Improved module boundaries
3. Cleaner Python code patterns
4. Improved MQL5 EA structure
5. Explanation of WHY each refactor improves robustness

Do NOT add new strategies.
Do NOT chase performance metrics.
Think like a reviewer preparing this system for long-term operation.
